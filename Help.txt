init.sh - the script which sets up the txt files with the players and the information needed
main.cpp - the code to generate all the possible lineups based on the txt generated
makecsv.sh - the code needed to take the output of the best lineups, and put them into a csv form
             It will create up to 150 csvs into a folder
             when uploading a csv to the fanduel website, can just choose the csv you want based on how many lineups you want

main.sh  -  Is a step by step process to go from start to end
            first copies the list of players from my desktop
            then runs the init.sh
            then runs main
            then creates the csv
            then finally sends the folder of csvs back to desktop
